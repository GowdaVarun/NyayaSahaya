FOREWORD
After having served as the fulcrum of criminal justice
administration for over 150 years, with several amendments and
upgrades, the erstwhile three Criminal Major Laws have recently
been replaced by Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Nagarik
Suraksha Sanhita and Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam through
Acts of Parliament. The enactment of the three new Criminal
Major Acts marks a significant post-colonial shift in the criminal
justice administration of our country; the distinguishing feature
being focus on ‘justice’ from conventionally being purely ‘penal’.
The new laws aim at structural overhaul of criminal justice
administration by acknowledging the changes that have taken
roots in a developing country and society over the past century
and, are futuristic in-as-much as they aim at providing a
cohesive definition and prescribing the consequences of new age
delinquencies in a rational, just and nationalistic framework.
The new laws are expected to be notified for implementation in
the coming days. It is going to be a multi-stakeholder endeavour
wherein central organizations like NCRB, BPR&D etc. will play
an important role along with State Police forces. For on-ground 
understanding and implementation of the new laws, Delhi
Police has already taken the first step with the preparation of this
comprehensive Handbook, which shows the commitment and
perseverance of our Training Division, under the able leadership
of Ms. Chhaya Sharma, Spl.CP/Training.
The challenge with adoption and implementation of the new
laws is primarily ‘attitudinal’. For a police force accustomed to
learning, practicing and internalizing laws that have been the
‘daily bread’ of policing for generations of police officers, the first
challenge is to acknowledge that development is de-envelopment
i.e., the old yolk is to be done away with. The process of unlearning
and re-learning can indeed be very difficult in absence of
experienced mentors, quality study material and structured,
practical tutoring. The Handbook at hand aims to fill the critical
second paradigm mentioned above, while we scout and prepare
professional trainers and lay down a calendar for training over
seventy thousand personnel of Delhi Police on this journey of
excitement and discoveries.
I once again extend my heartfelt compliments to the
entire team of Training Division of Delhi Police, who worked
assiduously, ably assisted by experts drawn from various
professions into drafting the Handbook and I am sure that this
will serve as the beacon light for not just Delhi Police but several
other State Police forces, who are moving along with us into the
future of national service through our policing efforts.

Commissioner of Police, Delhi

affecting the human body (murder) have been given precedence. Further,
the offences against women and children which were scattered throughout
in the erstwhile IPC have been brought together and have been consolidated

•	 To tackle ‘organised crime’ and ‘terrorist acts, offence of organised crime
and terrorist act have been added in the Sanhita with deterrent punishments.

Both the Sections also punish the act of being a member of any organised
crime syndicate or terrorist organisation, harboring or concealing any
person who committed any organised crime or Terrorist act and the act
of possessing any property derived or obtained from the commission of
organised crime or terrorist act. Section 111 on organised crime takes care

been drafted on the lines of UAPA. It has also been provided that in case of
the offence of terrorist act, officer not below the rank of SP will decide
whether to register a case under the provisions of BNS, 2023 or UAPA.
•	 A new offence for having sexual intercourse on false promise of marriage,
employment, promotion or by suppressing the identity etc. has been
introduced in Section 69 of the BNS. This provision will be a deterrent
for the people who employ deceitful means like false promise of marriage,
concealment of identity etc. to take consent of the woman and involve in
sexual intercourse. It aims to protect the rights of women.

BNS Handbook Delhi Police Academy
10 Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023
but which may extend to imprisonment for life (remainder of that person’s
natural life) as against up to 7 years imprisonment for grievous hurt earlier
in IPC.
•	 Punishment of Fine has been enhanced in 83 offences. (Annexure-IV)
Fine of 10/-, 100/-, 200/-, 250/-500/- etc. have been enhanced to 1000,

(Annexure-V) viz. buying child for the purpose of prostitution, organised
crime, terrorist act, hurt to deter public servant from his duty, personating
a public servant, theft etc.
•	 For the 1st time “Community Service” has been introduced as one of the
punishments specifically provided for 6 petty offences mentioned below.
It introduces the reformative approach in the punishment scheme which is
aimed towards achieving ‘NYAYA’ in the society
(1) Public Servant unlawfully engaging in trade u/s 202 BNS.
(2) Non-appearance in response to a proclamation published under sub
section (i) of section 84 of BNSS is punishable u/s 209 BNS.
(3) Attempt to commit suicide to compel or restrain exercise of lawful
power of public servant u/s 226 BNS.
(4) Petty theft on return of theft money and a person is convicted for the
first time U/s 303(2) BNS.
(5) Misconduct in public by a drunken person u/s 355 BNS.
(6) Defamation u/s 356 BNS.
•	 Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe her u/s 76
of BNS and Voyeurism u/s 77 of BNS has been made Gender neutral. The
offence relating to importation of a person from foreign country has also
been made gender neutral to cover both boys and girls in Section 141 of
the BNS, 2023. It will protect the minor boys and girls from being used for
the purposes of forced or seduced illicit intercourse.
•	 Age based parameters for differential punishment (for gang rape of 
BNS Handbook Delhi Police Academy
Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 11
a minor girl) has been removed and now Section 70(2) prescribes life
imprisonment (till remainder of that person’s natural life) or death for gang
rape of a woman below the age of 18 years.
•	 Definition of Child is added in Sec. 2 (3) and transgender has been
included in the definition of ‘Gender’ Sec. 2(10) as any person including
transgender with male and female. Uniformity has been introduced in the
use of expression ‘child’ throughout the BNS, 2023 which is achieved by
replacing the expression ‘minor’ and ‘child under the age of eighteen years’
with the word ‘child’.
•	 Replacing ‘Night’ with ‘after sunset and before sunrise’.
•	 Movable property includes tangible as well as intangible property. [Sec 2
(21)]
•	 Section 303 (2) of the BNS, 2023 presents a fine example of deterrence
and reformative approach of punishment. On the one hand, for a second
conviction of any person ‘for theft’, the section prescribes a higher
punishment up to 5 years with a mandatory minimum of 1 year, on the
other hand where the value of stolen property is less than 5,000 rupees
and the first-time offender restores the stolen property, the punishment of
community service has only been prescribed.

Layout Design of Integrated Circuits: The Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout
Design Act, 2000
Protection of Undisclosed Information: No exclusive legislation exists but the matter
would be generally covered under the Contract Act, 1872
Geographical Indications: The Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and
Protection) Act, 1999
Plant Varieties: The Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001
3. Who are responsible for administration of IPRs in the country?
Patents, designs, trademarks and geographical indications are administered by the
Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks which is under the control of the
Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion, Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Copyright is under the charge of the Ministry of Human Resource Development. The Act
on Layout-Design of Integrated Circuits is administered by the Ministry of
Telecommunication and Information Technology. Protection of Plant Varieties and
Farmers’ Rights Authority, Ministry of Agriculture administers the Act on Plant Variety.
..1..
Patents
4. What is a patent?
A patent is an exclusive ownership right granted by a country to the owner of an
invention, provided the invention satisfies certain conditions stipulated in the law. A
Letters Patent (a kind of certificate) is issued to the owner of the invention by the patent
office of the country conferring this right. Exclusivity of right implies that no one else
can make, use, manufacture or market the invention without the consent of the patent
holder. This right is available to the owner of the invention only for a limited period of
time. However, the use or exploitation of a patent may be affected by other laws of the
country which has awarded the patent. These laws may relate to health, safety, food,
security etc.
A patent in the law is a property right and hence, it can be gifted, inherited, assigned, sold
or licensed. As the right is conferred by the State, it can be revoked by the State under
very special circumstances for the benefit of public even if the patent has been sold or
licensed or manufactured or marketed in the meantime. The patent right is territorial in
nature meaning thereby, that a patent granted in India can only be enforced in India. In
case the owner of the invention wishes to obtain patents in other countries, the owner will
have to file separate patent applications in countries of his interest, along with necessary
fees.
5. What is expected from patentee as an obligation to the State?
A patentee must disclose the invention in a patent document for people to practice it after
the expiry of the term of the patent or after the patent has lapsed due to nonpayment of
maintenance fee or practice it with the consent of the patent holder during the life of the
patent. Disclosure of an invention is a legal requirement for obtaining a patent.
6. How is invention defined in the Indian Patents Act, which can qualify for grant of
a patent?
Invention means a new product or process involving an inventive step and capable of
industrial application.
Capable of industrial application means that the invention is capable of being made or
used in an industry.
7. How do you explain the term ‘a new product or a process’?
An invention is considered new or novel if it is not known to the public through
publication or prior use anywhere in the world. The invention should not be a part of the
existing global state of the art. Information appearing in magazines, technical journals,
..2..
books, newspapers, published patents etc. constitute the state of the art. Oral description
of the invention in a seminar/conference can also spoil novelty. Novelty is always
assessed in the global context. An invention will cease to be novel if it has been disclosed
in public through any type of publications anywhere in the world before filing a patent
application in respect of the invention. Prior use of the invention before the filing date
can also destroy the novelty. Novelty is determined through extensive literature and
patent searches. It should be realized that patent search is essential and critical for
ascertaining novelty as most of the information reported in patent documents does not
usually get published anywhere else or it is published in technical literature after a fairly
long gap.
8. How is inventiveness defined in the Indian Patents Act? Explain the meaning of
the term.
Inventive step is defined as a feature of an invention that involves technical advance as
compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both and that
makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.
A person skilled in the art means a person having knowledge and skill in the subject
matter of the patent application. This term has not been defined in terms of educational
qualifications and experience. Inventiveness is different from novelty in the sense that an
invention must lead to a technical advance. Replacement of a wooden knob in an almirah
by a metallic knob is not considered inventive. A substantial degree of interpretation is
called for in determining the inventiveness. Inventiveness cannot be decided on the basis
of the material contained in unpublished patents. This would mean that while deciding
inventiveness of an invention one has to examine it in the light of published information
on the date of filing of the patent application. The complexity or the simplicity of an
inventive step does not have any bearing on the grant of a patent. In other words a very
simple invention can qualify for a patent. A mere 'scintilla' of invention is sufficient to
found a valid patent.
9. What are the types of inventions which are not patentable in India?
An invention may satisfy the condition of novelty, inventiveness and usefulness but it
may not qualify for a patent under the following situations:
(i) an invention which is frivolous or which claims anything obviously contrary to
well established natural laws;
(ii) an invention the primary or intended use or commercial exploitation of which
could be contrary to public order or morality or which causes serious prejudice
to human , animal or plant life or health or to the environment;
(iii) the mere discovery of scientific principle or the formulation of an abstract
theory or discovery of any living thing or non-living substance occurring in
nature;
(iv) the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result
in enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery
of any new property or new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a
..3..
known process, machine or apparatus unless such known process results in a
new product or employs at least one new reactant;
Explanation: For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs,
metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes,
combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to
be the same substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with
regards to efficacy.
(v) a substance obtained by mere admixture resulting only in the aggregation of the
properties of the components thereof or a process for producing such
substance;
(vii) the mere arrangement or re-arrangement or duplication of known devices each
functioning independently of one another in a known way;
(ix) a method of agriculture or horticulture;
(x) any process for medicinal, surgical, curative, prophylactic (diagnostic,
therapeutic) or other treatment of human beings or any process for a similar
treatment of animals to render them free of disease or to increase their
economic value or that of their products;
(xi) plants and animals in whole or any part thereof other than microorganisms but
including seeds, varieties and species and essentially biological processes for
production or propagation of plants and animals;
(xii) a mathematical or business method or a computer program per se or
algorithms;
(xiii) a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or any other aesthetic creation
whatsoever including cinematographic works and television productions;
(xiv) a mere scheme or rule or method of performing mental act or method of
playing game;
(xv) a presentation of information;
(xvi) topography of integrated circuits;
(xvii) an invention which, in effect, is traditional knowledge or which is an
aggregation or duplication of known properties of traditionally known
component or components;
(xviii) inventions relating to atomic energy;
10. When should an application for a patent be filed?
Filing of an application for a patent should be completed at the earliest possible date and
should not be delayed. An application filed with provisional specification, disclosing the
essence of the nature of the invention helps to register the priority by the applicant. Delay
in filing an application may entail some risks such as (i) some other inventor might file a
patent application on the said invention and (ii) there may be either an inadvertent
publication of the invention by the inventor himself/herself or by others independently of
him/her.
11. Can a published or disclosed invention be patented?
..4..
No. Publication of an invention in any form by the inventor before filing of a patent
application would disqualify the invention to be patentable. However, a grace period of
12 months is available in India for filing a patent application after disclosure of the
invention through publication or display. This grace period is available only when such
publications or displays are done in government notified exhibitions or paper read before
learned society. A patent application must be filed before the grace period ends. A
practical advice to inventors is that they should try to utilize the grace period only under
special circumstances. As a matter of sound practice they should not disclose their
invention before filing the patent application. The invention can be considered for
publication after a patent application has been filed. Thus, it can be seen that there is no
contradiction between publishing an inventive work and filing a patent application in
respect of the invention.
12. What is considered as the date of patent?
The date of patent is the date of filing the application for patent (whether provisional or
complete). The term of the patent is counted from this date.
13. What is the term of a patent in the Indian system?
Term of the patent is 20 years from the date of filing for all types of inventions.
14. How does one keep a patent in force for the full patent term?
A patent has to be maintained by paying the maintenance fees every year. If the
maintenance fees are not paid, the patent will cease to remain in force and the invention
becomes open to public. Anyone can then utilize the patent without the danger of
infringing the patent.
15. What are the essential documents to be generated and submitted by a potential
patentee?
There are two types of patent documents usually known as patent specification, namely
(i) Provisional Specification and (ii) Complete Specification
Provisional Specification
A provisional specification is usually filed to establish priority of the invention in case
the disclosed invention is only at an early stage and a delay is .

Chapter 19
Cyber Laws in India
Objectives: This chapter presents the meaning and definition of cyber crime, the legislation in India
dealing with offences relating to the use of or concerned with the abuse of computers or other electronic
gadgets. The Information Technology Act 2000 and the I.T. Amendment Act 2008 have been dealt
with in detail and other legislations dealing with electronic offences have been discussed in brief.
Introduction:
Crime is both a social and economic phenomenon. It is as old as human society. Many ancient
books right from pre-historic days, and mythological stories have spoken about crimes
committed by individuals be it against another individual like ordinary theft and burglary or
against the nation like spying, treason etc. Kautilya’s Arthashastra written around 350 BC,
considered to be an authentic administrative treatise in India, discusses the various crimes,
security initiatives to be taken by the rulers, possible crimes in a state etc. and also advocates
punishment for the list of some stipulated offences. Different kinds of punishments have been
prescribed for listed offences and the concept of restoration of loss to the victims has also been
discussed in it.
Crime in any form adversely affects all the members of the society. In developing economies, cyber
crime has increased at rapid strides, due to the rapid diffusion of the Internet and the digitisation of
economic activities. Thanks to the huge penetration of technology in almost all walks of society right
from corporate governance and state administration, up to the lowest level of petty shop keepers
computerizing their billing system, we find computers and other electronic devices pervading the
human life. The penetration is so deep that man cannot spend a day without computers or a mobile.
Snatching some one’s mobile will tantamount to dumping one in solitary confinement!
Cyber Crime is not defined in Information Technology Act 2000 nor in the I.T. Amendment Act 2008
nor in any other legislation in India. In fact, it cannot be too. Offence or crime has been dealt with
elaborately listing various acts and the punishments for each, under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and
quite a few other legislations too. Hence, to define cyber crime, we can say, it is just a combination of
crime and computer. To put it in simple terms ‘any offence or crime in which a computer is used is a
cyber crime’. Interestingly even a petty offence like stealing or pick-pocket can be brought within the
broader purview of cyber crime if the basic data or aid to such an offence is a computer or an
information stored in a computer used (or misused) by the fraudster. The I.T. Act defines a computer,
computer network, data, information and all other necessary ingredients that form part of a cyber crime,
about which we will now be discussing in detail.
In a cyber crime, computer or the data itself the target or the object of offence or a tool in committing
some other offence, providing the necessary inputs for that offence. All such acts of crime will come
under the broader definition of cyber crime.

Let us now discuss in detail, the Information Technology Act -2000 and the I.T. Amendment Act 2008
in general and with particular reference to banking and financial sector related transactions. Before
going into the section-wise or chapter-wise description of various provisions of the Act, let us discuss
the history behind such a legislation in India, the circumstances under which the Act was passed and the
purpose or objectives in passing it.
The Genesis of IT legislation in India: Mid 90’s saw an impetus in globalization and computerisation,
with more and more nations computerizing their governance, and e-commerce seeing an enormous
growth. Until then, most of international trade and transactions were done through documents being
transmitted through post and by telex only. Evidences and records, until then, were predominantly
paper evidences and paper records or other forms of hard-copies only. With much of international trade
being done through electronic communication and with email gaining momentum, an urgent and
imminent need was felt for recognizing electronic records ie the data what is stored in a computer or an
external storage attached thereto.
The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted the Model Law on
e-commerce in 1996. The General Assembly of United Nations passed a resolution in January 1997
inter alia, recommending all States in the UN to give favourable considerations to the said Model Law,
which provides for recognition to electronic records and according it the same treatment like a paper
communication and record.
Objectives of I.T. legislation in India: . It is against this background the Government of India
enacted its Information Technology Act 2000 with the objectives as follows, stated in the preface to the
Act itself.
“to provide legal recognition for transactions carried out by means of electronic data interchange and
other means of electronic communication, commonly referred to as "electronic commerce", which
involve the use of alternatives to paper-based methods of communication and storage of information, to
facilitate electronic filing of documents with the Government agencies and further to amend the Indian
Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1891 and the Reserve
Bank of India Act, 1934 and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”
The Information Technology Act, 2000, was thus passed as the Act No.21 of 2000, got President assent
on 9 June and was made effective from 17 October 2000.
The Act essentially deals with the following issues:
 Legal Recognition of Electronic Documents
 Legal Recognition of Digital Signatures
 Offenses and Contraventions
 Justice Dispensation Systems for cyber crimes.
Amendment Act 2008: Being the first legislation in the nation on technology, computers and ecommerce and e-communication, the Act was the subject of extensive debates, elaborate reviews and
detailed criticisms, with one arm of the industry criticizing some sections of the Act to be draconian and
other stating it is too diluted and lenient. There were some conspicuous omissions too resulting in the
investigators relying more and more on the time-tested (one and half century-old) Indian Penal Code
even in technology based cases with the I.T. Act also being referred in the process and the reliance
more on IPC rather on the ITA.
3
Thus the need for an amendment – a detailed one – was felt for the I.T. Act almost from the year 2003-
04 itself. Major industry bodies were consulted and advisory groups were formed to go into the
perceived lacunae in the I.T. Act and comparing it with similar legislations in other nations and to
suggest recommendations. Such recommendations were analysed and subsequently taken up as a
comprehensive Amendment Act and after considerable administrative procedures, the consolidated
amendment called the Information Technology Amendment Act 2008 was placed in the Parliament and
passed without much debate, towards the end of 2008 (by which time the Mumbai terrorist attack of 26
November 2008 had taken place). This Amendment Act got the President assent on 5 Feb 2009 and
was made effective from 27 October 2009.
Some of the notable features of the ITAA are as follows:
 Focussing on data privacy
 Focussing on Information Security
 Defining cyber café
 Making digital signature technology neutral
 Defining reasonable security practices to be followed by corporate
 Redefining the role of intermediaries
 Recognising the role of Indian Computer Emergency Response Team
 Inclusion of some additional cyber crimes like child pornography and cyber terrorism
 authorizing an Inspector to investigate cyber offences (as against the DSP earlier)
In this chapter, we will be broadly discussing the various provisions of ITA 2000 and wherever the
same has been amended or a new section added as per the ITAA 2008, such remark will be made
appropriately.
How the Act is structured: The Act totally has 13 chapters and 90 sections (the last four sections
namely sections 91 to 94 in the ITA 2000 dealt with the amendments to the four Acts namely the Indian
Penal Code 1860, The Indian Evidence Act 1872, The Bankers’ Books Evidence Act 1891 and the
Reserve Bank of India Act 1934). The Act begins with preliminary and definitions and from thereon
the chapters that follow deal with authentication of electronic records, digital signatures, electronic
signatures etc.
Elaborate procedures for certifying authorities (for digital certificates as per IT Act -2000 and since
replaced by electronic signatures in the ITAA -2008) have been spelt out. The civil offence of data theft
and the process of adjudication and appellate procedures have been described. Then the Act goes on to
define and describe some of the well-known cyber crimes and lays down the punishments therefore.
Then the concept of due diligence, role of intermediaries and some miscellaneous provisions have been
described.
Rules and procedures mentioned in the Act have also been laid down in a phased manner, with the
latest one on the definition of private and sensitive personal data and the role of intermediaries, due
diligence etc., being defined as recently as April 2011. We will be discussing some of the important
provisions of such rules also in the later part of this chapter.
Applicability: The Act extends to the whole of India and except as otherwise provided, it applies to
also any offence or contravention there under committed outside India by any person. There are some
specific exclusions to the Act (ie where it is not applicable) as detailed in the First Schedule, stated
below:
4
a) negotiable instrument (Other than a cheque) as defined in section 13 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, 1881;
b) a power-of-attorney as defined in section 1A of the Powers-of-Attorney Act, 1882;
c) a trust as defined in section 3 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882
d) a will as defined in clause (h) of section 2 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 including
any other testamentary disposition
e) any contract for the sale or conveyance of immovable property or any interest in such
property;
f) any such class of documents or transactions as may be notified by the Central
Government
Definitions: The ITA-2000 defines many important words used in common computer parlance like
‘access’, ‘computer resource’, ‘computer system’, ‘communication device’, ‘data’, ‘information’,
’security procedure’ etc. The definition of the word ‘computer’ itself assumes significance here.
‘Computer’ means any electronic magnetic, optical or other high-speed data processing device or
system which performs logical, arithmetic, and memory functions by manipulations of electronic,
magnetic or optical impulses, and includes all input, output, processing, storage, computer software, or
communication facilities which are connected or related to the computer in a computer system or
computer network;
So is the word ‘computer system’ which means a device or a collection of devices with input, output
and storage capabilities. Interestingly, the word ‘computer’ and ‘computer system’ have been so widely
defined to mean any electronic device with data processing capability, performing computer functions
like logical, arithmetic and memory functions with input, storage and output capabilities. A careful
reading of the words will make one understand that a high-end programmable gadgets like even a
washing machine or switches and routers used in a network can all be brought under the definition.
Similarly the word ‘communication devices’ inserted in the ITAA-2008 has been given an inclusive
definition, taking into its coverage cell phones, personal digital assistance or such other devices used to
transmit any text, video etc like what was later being marketed as iPad or other similar devices on Wi-fi
and cellular models. Definitions for some words like ‘cyber café’ were also later incorporated in the
ITAA 2008 when ‘Indian Computer response Emergency Team’ was included.
Digital Signature: ‘Electronic signature’ was defined in the ITAA -2008 whereas the earlier ITA -2000
covered in detail about digital signature, defining it and elaborating the procedure to obtain the digital
signature certificate and giving it legal validity. Digital signature was defined in the ITA -2000 as
“authentication of electronic record” as per procedure laid down in Section 3 and Section 3 discussed
the use of asymmetric crypto system and the use of Public Key Infrastructure and hash function etc.
This was later criticized to be technology dependent ie., relying on the specific technology of
asymmetric crypto system and the hash function generating a pair of public and private key
authentication etc.
Thus Section 3 which was originally “Digital Signature” was later renamed as “Digital Signature and
Electronic Signature” in ITAA - 2008 thus introducing technological neutrality by adoption of
electronic signatures as a legally valid mode of executing signatures. This includes digital signatures as
one of the modes of signatures and is far broader in ambit covering biometrics and other new forms of
creating electronic signatures not confining the recognition to digital signature process alone. While
M/s. TCS, M/s. Safescript and M/s. MTNL are some of the digital signature certifying authorities in
5
India, IDRBT (Institute for Development of Research in Banking Technology – the research wing of
RBI) is the Certifying Authorities (CA) for the Indian Banking and financial sector licensed by the
Controller of Certifying Authorities, Government of India.
It is relevant to understand the meaning of digital signature (or electronic signature) here. It would be
pertinent to note that electronic signature (or the earlier digital signature) as stipulated in the Act is
NOT a digitized signature or a scanned signature. In fact, in electronic signature (or digital signature)
there is no real signature by the person, in the conventional sense of the term. Electronic signature is
not the process of storing ones signature or scanning ones signature and sending it in an electronic
communication like email. It is a process of authentication of message using the procedure laid down
in Section 3 of the Act.
The other forms of authentication that are simpler to use such as biometric based retina scanning etc can
be quite useful in effective implementation of the Act. However, the Central Government has to evolve
detailed procedures and increase awareness on the use of such systems among the public by putting in
place the necessary tools and stipulating necessary conditions. Besides, duties of electronic signature
certificate issuing authorities for bio-metric based authentication mechanisms have to be evolved and
the necessary parameters have to be formulated to make it user-friendly and at the same time without
compromising security.
e-Governance: Chapter III discusses Electronic governance issues and procedures and the legal
recognition to electronic records is dealt with in detail in Section 4 followed by description of
procedures on electronic records, storage and maintenance and according recognition to the validity of
contracts formed through electronic means.
Procedures relating to electronic signatures and regulatory guidelines for certifying authorities have
been laid down in the sections that follow.
Chapter IX dealing with Penalties, Compensation and Adjudication is a major significant step in the
direction of combating data theft, claiming compensation, introduction of security practices etc
discussed in Section 43, and which deserve detailed description.
Section 43 deals with penalties and compensation for damage to computer, computer system etc.
This section is the first major and significant legislative step in India to combat the issue of data theft.
The IT industry has for long been clamouring for a legislation in India to address the crime of data theft,
just like physical theft or larceny of goods and commodities. This Section addresses the civil offence of
theft of data. If any person without permission of the owner or any other person who is in charge of a
computer, accesses or downloads, copies or extracts any data or introduces any computer contaminant
like virus or damages or disrupts any computer or denies access to a computer to an authorised user or
tampers etc…he shall be liable to pay damages to the person so affected. Earlier in the ITA -2000 the
maximum damages under this head was Rs.1 crore, which (the ceiling) was since removed in the ITAA
2008.
The essence of this Section is civil liability. Criminality in the offence of data theft is being separately
dealt with later under Sections 65 and 66. Writing a virus program or spreading a virus mail, a bot, a
Trojan or any other malware in a computer network or causing a Denial of Service Attack in a server
will all come under this Section and attract civil liability by way of compensation. Under this Section,
words like Computer Virus, Compute Contaminant, Computer database and Source Code are all
described and defined.
6
Questions like the employees’ liability in an organisation which is sued against for data theft or such
offences and the amount of responsibility of the employer or the owner and the concept of due diligence
were all debated in the first few years of ITA -2000 in court litigations like the bazee.com case and
other cases. Subsequently need was felt for defining the corporate liability for data protection and
information security at the corporate level was given a serious look.
Thus the new Section 43-A dealing with compensation for failure to protect data was introduced in the
ITAA -2008. This is another watershed in the area of data protection especially at the corporate level.
As per this Section, where a body corporate is negligent in implementing reasonable security practices
and thereby causes wrongful loss or gain to any person, such body corporate shall be liable to pay
damages by way of compensation to the person so affected. The Section further explains the phrase
‘body corporate’ and quite significantly the phrases ‘reasonable security practices and procedures’ and
‘sensitive personal data or information’.
Thus the corporate responsibility for data protection is greatly emphasized by inserting Section 43A
whereby corporates are under an obligation to ensure adoption of reasonable security practices. Further
what is sensitive personal data has since been clarified by the central government vide its Notification
dated 11 April 2011 giving the list of all such data which includes password, details of bank accounts or
card details, medical records etc. After this notification, the IT industry in the nation including techsavvy and widely technology-based banking and other sectors became suddenly aware of the
responsibility of data protection and a general awareness increased on what is data privacy and what is
the role of top management and the Information Security Department in organisations in ensuring data
protection, especially while handling the customers’ and other third party data.

 Reasonable Security Practices
 Site certification
 Security initiatives
 Awareness Training
 Conformance to Standards, certification
 Policies and adherence to policies
 Policies like password policy, Access
Control, email Policy etc
 Periodic monitoring and review.

The Information Technology (Reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data
or information) Rules have since been notified by the Government of India, Dept of I.T. on 11 April
2011. Any body corporate or a person on its behalf shall be considered to have complied with
reasonable security practices and procedures, if they have implemented such security practices and
standards and have a comprehensive documented information security programme and information
security policies containing managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures
commensurate with the information assets being protected with the nature of business. In the event of
an information security breach, the body corporate or a person on its behalf shall be required to
demonstrate, as and when called upon to do so by the agency mandated under the law, that they have
implemented security control measures as per their documented information security programme and
7
information security policies. The international Standard IS/ISO/IEC 27001 on "Information
Technology – Security Techniques - Information Security Management System - Requirements" is one
such standard referred to in sub-rule (1).
In view of the foregoing, it has now become a major compliance issue on the part of not only IT
companies but also those in the Banking and Financial Sector especially those banks with huge
computerised operations dealing with public data and depending heavily on technology. In times of a
litigation or any security breach resulting in a claim of compensation of financial loss amount or
damages, it would be the huge responsibility on the part of those body corporate to prove that that said
“Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures” were actually in place and all the steps mentioned in
the Rules passed in April 2011 stated above, have been taken.
In the near future, this is one of the sections that is going to create much noise and be the subject of
much debates in the event of litigations, like in re-defining the role of an employee, the responsibility of
an employer or the top management in data protection and issues like the actual and vicarious
responsibility, the actual and contributory negligence of all stake holders involved etc.
The issue has wider ramifications especially in the case of a cloud computing scenario (the practice of
using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than
a local server, with the services managed by the provider sold on demand, for the amount of time used)
where more and more organisations handle the data of others and the information is stored elsewhere
and not in the owners’ system. Possibly, more debates will emanate on the question of information
owners vis a vis the information container and the information custodians and the Service Level
Agreements of all parties involved will assume a greater significance.
Adjudication: Having dealt with civil offences, the Act then goes on to describe civil remedy to such
offences in the form of adjudication without having to resort to the procedure of filing a complaint with
the police or other investigating agencies. Adjudication powers and procedures have been elaborately
laid down in Sections 46 and thereafter. The Central Government may appoint any officer not below
the rank of a director to the Government of India or a state Government as the adjudicator. The I.T.
Secretary in any state is normally the nominated Adjudicator for all civil offences arising out of data
thefts and resultant losses in the particular state. If at all one section can be criticized to be absolutely
lacking in popularity in the IT Act, it is this provision. In the first ten years of existence of the ITA,
there have been only a very few applications made in the nation, that too in the major metros almost all
of which are under different stages of judicial process and adjudications have been obtained in possibly
less than five cases. The first adjudication obtained under this provision was in Chennai, Tamil Nadu,
in a case involving ICICI Bank in which the bank was told to compensate the applicant with the
amount wrongfully debited in Internet Banking, along with cost and damages. in April 2010.
This section should be given much popularity and awareness should be spread among the public
especially the victims of cyber crimes and data theft that such a procedure does exist without recourse
to going to the police and filing a case. It is time the state spends some time and thought in enhancing
awareness on the provision of adjudication for civil offences in cyber litigations like data theft etc so
that the purpose for which such useful provisions have been made, are effectively utilized by the litigant
public.
There is an appellate procedure under this process and the composition of Cyber Appellate Tribunal at
the national level, has also been described in the Act. Every adjudicating officer has the powers of a
8
civil court and the Cyber Appellate Tribunal has the powers vested in a civil court under the Code of
Civil Procedure.
After discussing the procedures relating to appeals etc and the duties and powers of Cyber Appellate
Tribunal, the Act moves to the actual criminal acts coming under the broader definition of cyber crimes.
It would be pertinent to note that the Act only lists some of the cyber crimes, (without defining a cyber
crime) and stipulates the punishments for such offences. The criminal provisions of the IT Act and
those dealing with cognizable offences and criminal acts follow from Chapter IX titled “Offences”
Section 65: Tampering with source documents is dealt with under this section. Concealing, destroying,
altering any computer source code when the same is required to be kept or maintained by law is an
offence punishable with three years imprisonment or two lakh rupees or with both. Fabrication of an
electronic record or committing forgery by way of interpolations in CD produced as evidence in a court
(Bhim Sen Garg vs State of Rajasthan and others, 2006, Cri LJ, 3463, Raj 2411) attract punishment
under this Section. Computer source code under this Section refers to the listing of programmes,
computer commands, design and layout etc in any form.
Section 66: Computer related offences are dealt with under this Section. Data theft stated in Section
43 is referred to in this Section. Whereas it was a plain and simple civil offence with the remedy of
compensation and damages only, in that Section, here it is the same act but with a criminal intention
thus making it a criminal offence. The act of data theft or the offence stated in Section 43 if done
dishonestly or fraudulently becomes a punishable offence under this Section and attracts imprisonment
upto three years or a fine of five lakh rupees or both. Earlier hacking was defined in Sec 66 and it was
an offence.
Now after the amendment, data theft of Sec 43 is being referred to in Sec 66 by making this section
more purposeful and the word ‘hacking’ is not used. The word ‘hacking’ was earlier called a crime in
this Section and at the same time, courses on ‘ethical hacking’ were also taught academically. This led
to an anomalous situation of people asking how an illegal activity be taught academically with a word
‘ethical’ prefixed to it. Then can there be training programmes, for instance, on “Ethical burglary”,
“Ethical Assault” etc say for courses on physical defence? This tricky situation was put an end to, by
the ITAA when it re-phrased the Section 66 by mapping it with the civil liability of Section 43 and
removing the word ‘Hacking’. However the act of hacking is still certainly an offence as per this
Section, though some experts interpret ‘hacking’ as generally for good purposes (obviously to facilitate
naming of the courses as ethical hacking) and ‘cracking’ for illegal purposes. It would be relevant to
note that the technology involved in both is the same and the act is the same, whereas in ‘hacking’ the
owner’s consent is obtained or assumed and the latter act ‘cracking’ is perceived to be an offence.
Thanks to ITAA, Section 66 is now a widened one with a list of offences as follows:
66A Sending offensive messages thro communication service, causing annoyance etc through an
electronic communication or sending an email to mislead or deceive the recipient about the origin of
such messages (commonly known as IP or email spoofing) are all covered here. Punishment for these
acts is imprisonment upto three years or fine.
66B Dishonestly receiving stolen computer resource or communication device with punishment upto
three years or one lakh rupees as fine or both.
66C Electronic signature or other identity theft like using others’ password or electronic signature etc.
Punishment is three years imprisonment or fine of one lakh rupees or both.
9
66D Cheating by personation using computer resource or a communication device shall be punished
with imprisonment of either description for a term which extend to three years and shall also be liable to
fine which may extend to one lakh rupee.
66E Privacy violation – Publishing or transmitting private area of any person without his or her consent
etc. Punishment is three years imprisonment or two lakh rupees fine or both.
66F Cyber terrorism – Intent to threaten the unity, integrity, security or sovereignty of the nation and
denying access to any person authorized to access the computer resource or attempting to penetrate or
access a computer resource without authorization. Acts of causing a computer contaminant (like virus
or Trojan Horse or other spyware or malware) likely to cause death or injuries to persons or damage to
or destruction of property etc. come under this Section. Punishment is life imprisonment.
It may be observed that all acts under S.66 are cognizable and non-bailable offences. Intention or the
knowledge to cause wrongful loss to others ie the existence of criminal intention and the evil mind ie
concept of mens rea, destruction, deletion, alteration or diminishing in value or utility of data are all
the major ingredients to bring any act under this Section.
To summarise, what was civil liability with entitlement for compensations and damages in Section 43,
has been referred to here, if committed with criminal intent, making it a criminal liability attracting
imprisonment and fine or both.
Section 67 deals with publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form. The earlier
Section in ITA was later widened as per ITAA 2008 in which child pornography and retention of
records by intermediaries were all included.
Publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form is dealt with here. Whoever publishes or
transmits any material which is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or if its effect is such as to
tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read the matter contained in it, shall be punished
with first conviction for a term upto three years and fine of five lakh rupees and in second conviction
for a term of five years and fine of ten lakh rupees or both.
This Section is of historical importance since the landmark judgement in what is considered to be the
first ever conviction under I.T. Act 2000 in India, was obtained in this Section in the famous case “State
of Tamil Nadu vs Suhas Katti” on 5 November 2004. The strength of the Section and the reliability of
electronic evidences were proved by the prosecution and conviction was brought about in this case,
involving sending obscene message in the name of a married women amounting to cyber stalking, email
spoofing and the criminal activity stated in this Section.
Section 67-A deals with publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act in
electronic form. Contents of Section 67 when combined with the material containing sexually explicit
material attract penalty under this Section.
Child Pornography has been exclusively dealt with under Section 67B. Depicting children engaged
in sexually explicit act, creating text or digital images or advertising or promoting such material
depicting children in obscene or indecent manner etc or facilitating abusing children online or inducing
children to online relationship with one or more children etc come under this Section. ‘Children’ means
persons who have not completed 18 years of age, for the purpose of this Section. Punishment for the
first conviction is imprisonment for a maximum of five years and fine of ten lakh rupees and in the
event of subsequent conviction with imprisonment of seven years and fine of ten lakh rupees.
10
Bonafide heritage material being printed or distributed for the purpose of education or literature etc are
specifically excluded from the coverage of this Section, to ensure that printing and distribution of
ancient epics or heritage material or pure academic books on education and medicine are not unduly
affected.
Screening videographs and photographs of illegal activities through Internet all come under this
category, making pornographic video or MMS clippings or distributing such clippings through mobile
or other forms of communication through the Internet fall under this category.
Section 67C fixes the responsibility to intermediaries that they shall preserve and retain such
information as may be specified for such duration and in such manner as the Central Government may
prescribe. Non-compliance is an offence with imprisonment upto three years or fine.
Transmission of electronic message and communication:
Section 69: This is an interesting section in the sense that it empowers the Government or agencies as
stipulated in the Section, to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted,
received or stored in any computer resource, subject to compliance of procedure as laid down here.
This power can be exercised if the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, is
satisfied that it is necessary or expedient in the interest of sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of
India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing
incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above or for investigation of any
offence. In any such case too, the necessary procedure as may be prescribed, is to be followed and the
reasons for taking such action are to be recorded in writing, by order, directing any agency of the
appropriate Government. The subscriber or intermediary shall extend all facilities and technical
assistance when called upon to do so.
Section 69A inserted in the ITAA, vests with the Central Government or any of its officers
with the powers to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through
any computer resource, under the same circumstances as mentioned above. Section 69B
discusses the power to authorise to monitor and collect traffic data or information through any
computer resource.
Commentary on the powers to intercept, monitor and block websites: In short, under the
conditions laid down in the Section, power to intercept, monitor or decrypt does exist. It would
be interesting to trace the history of telephone tapping in India and the legislative provisions
(or the lack of it?) in our nation and compare it with the powers mentioned here. Until the
passage of this Section in the ITAA, phone tapping was governed by Clause 5(2) of the Indian
Telegraph Act of 1885, which said that “On the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the
interest of the public safety, the Government may, if satisfied that it is necessary or expedient
so to do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State,
friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the
commission of an offence, for reasons to be recorded in writing, by order, direct that any
message or class of messages to or from any person or class of persons, or relating to any
particular subject, brought for transmission by or transmitted or received by any telegraph,
shall not be transmitted, or shall be intercepted or detained, or shall be disclosed to the
Government making the order or an officer thereof mentioned in the order”. Other sections of
the act mention that the government should formulate “precautions to be taken for preventing
the improper interception or disclosure of messages”. There have been many attempts, rather
many requests, to formulate rules to govern the operation of Clause 5(2). But ever since 1885,
11
no government has formulated any such precautions, maybe for obvious reasons to retain the
spying powers for almost a century.
 A writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court in 1991 by the People’s Union for Civil
Liberties, challenging the constitutional validity of this Clause 5(2). The petition argued that it
infringed the constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression and to life and personal
liberty. In December 1996, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment, pointing out that
“unless a public emergency has occurred or the interest of public safety demands, the
authorities have no jurisdiction to exercise the powers” given them under 5(2). They went on
to define them thus: a public emergency was the “prevailing of a sudden condition or state of
affairs affecting the people at large calling for immediate action”, and public safety “means the
state or condition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at large”. Without those two,
however “necessary or expedient”, it could not do so. Procedures for keeping such records and
the layer of authorities etc were also stipulated.
Now, this Section 69 of ITAA is far more intrusive and more powerful than the above-cited
provision of Indian Telegraph Act 1885. Under this ITAA Section, the nominated
Government official will be able to listen in to all phone calls, read the SMSs and emails, and
monitor the websites that one visited, subject to adherence to the prescribed procedures and
without a warrant from a magistrate’s order. In view of the foregoing, this Section was
critizised to be draconian vesting the government with much more powers than required.
Having said this, we should not be oblivious to the fact that this power (of intercepting,
monitoring and blocking) is something which the Government represented by the Indian
Computer Emergency Response Team, (the National Nodal Agency, as nominated in
Section 70B of ITAA) has very rarely exercised. Perhaps believing in the freedom of
expression and having confidence in the self-regulative nature of the industry, the CERT-In has
stated that these powers are very sparingly (and almost never) used by it.
Critical Information Infrastructure and Protected System have been discussed in Section 70.
The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) coming under the Ministry of
Information and Technology, Government of India, has been designated as the National Nodal
Agency for incident response. By virtue of this, CERT-In will perform activities like
collection, analysis and dissemination of information on cyber incidents, forecasts and alerts of
cyber security incidents, emergency measures for handling cyber security incidents etc.
The role of CERT-In in e-publishing security vulnerabilities and security alerts is remarkable.
The Minister of State for Communications and IT Mr.Sachin Pilot said in a written reply to
the Rajya Sabha said that (as reported in the Press), CERT-In has handled over 13,000 such
incidents in 2011 compared to 8,266 incidents in 2009. CERT-In has observed that there is significant
increase in the number of cyber security incidents in the country. A total of 8,266, 10,315 and 13,301
security incidents were reported to and handled by CERT-In during 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively,"
 These security incidents include website intrusions, phishing, network probing, spread of malicious
code like virus, worms and spam, he added. Hence the role of CERT-In is very crucial and there are
much expectations from CERT In not just in giving out the alerts but in combating cyber crime, use the
weapon of monitoring the web-traffic, intercepting and blocking the site, whenever so required and with
due process of law.
Penalty for breach of confidentiality and privacy is discussed in Section 72 with the punishment being
imprisonment for a term upto two years or a fine of one lakh rupees or both.
12
Considering the global nature of cyber crime and understanding the real time scenario of fraudster
living in one part of the world and committing a data theft or DoS(Denial of Service)
 kind of an attack or other cyber crime in an entirely different part of the world, Section 75 clearly
states that the Act applies to offences or contravention committed outside India, if the contravention or
the offence involves a computer or a computer network located in India.
This Act has over-riding provisions especially with regard to the regulations stipulated in the Code of
Criminal Procedure. As per Section 78, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, a police officer not below the rank of an Inspector shall investigate an offence under this
Act. Such powers were conferred to officers not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police
earlier in the ITA which was later amended as Inspector in the ITAA.
Due Diligence: Liability of intermediaries and the concept of Due Diligence has been discussed in
Section 79. As per this, intermediary shall not be liable for any third party information hosted by him,
if his function is limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made
available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hosted or if he does not initiate the
transmission, select the receiver of the transmission and select or modify the information contained in
the transmission and if he observes due diligence and follows the guidelines prescribed by the Central
Government.
This concept of due diligence is also much being debated. Due Diligence was first discussed as an
immediate fallout of the famous bazee.com case in New Delhi, when the NRI CEO of the company was
arrested for making the MMS clipping with objectionable obscene material depicting school children
was made available in the public domain website owned by him, for sale (and later the CD was sold).
The larger issue being discussed at that time was how far is the content provider responsible and how
far the Internet Service Provider and what is due diligence which as the CEO of the company, he should
have exercised.
After passage of the ITAA and the introduction of ‘reasonable security practices and procedures’ and
the responsibility of body corporate as seen earlier in Section 43A, and to set at rest some confusion on
the significance of due diligence and what constitutes due diligence, the DIT came out with a set of
rules titled Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules on 11 April 2011. As per this,
“the intermediary, on whose computer system the information is stored or hosted or published, upon
obtaining knowledge by itself or been brought to actual knowledge by an affected person in writing or
through email signed with electronic signature about any such information as mentioned in sub-rule (2)
above, shall act within thirty six hours and where applicable, work with user or owner of such
information to disable such information that is in contravention of sub-rule (2). Further the intermediary
shall preserve such information and associated records for at least ninety days for investigation
purposes…..”
In essence, an intermediary shall be liable for any contravention of law committed by any user unless
the Intermediary can prove that he has exercised due diligence and has not conspired or abetted in the
act of criminality.
Power to enter, search etc has been described in Section 80. Notwithstanding anything contained in the
Code of Criminal Procedure, any police officer, not below the rank of an Inspector or any other officer
….authorised ….may enter any public place and search and arrest without warrant any person found
therein who is reasonably suspected of having committed or of committing or of being about to commit
13
any offence under this Act. This is another effective weapon that has been rarely and almost never
utilised by the police officers.
The Act is applicable to electronic cheques and truncated cheques (ie the image of cheque being
presented and processed curtailing and truncating the physical movement of the cheque from the
collecting banker to the paying banker).
Overriding powers of the Act and the powers of Central Government to make rules and that of State
Governments to make rules wherever necessary have been discussed in the Sections that follow.
Other Acts amended by the ITA:
The Indian Penal Code, 1860: Normally referred to as the IPC, this is a very powerful legislation and
probably the most widely used in criminal jurisprudence, serving as the main criminal code of India.
Enacted originally in 1860 and amended many time since, it covers almost all substantive aspects of
criminal law and is supplemented by other criminal provisions. In independent India, many special
laws have been enacted with criminal and penal provisions which are often referred to and relied upon,
as an additional legal provision in cases which refer to the relevant provisions of IPC as well.
ITA 2000 has amended the sections dealing with records and documents in the IPC by inserting the
word ‘electronic’ thereby treating the electronic records and documents on a par with physical records
and documents. The Sections dealing with false entry in a record or false document etc (eg 192, 204,
463, 464, 464, 468 to 470, 471, 474, 476 etc) have since been amended as electronic record and
electronic document thereby bringing within the ambit of IPC, all crimes to an electronic record and
electronic documents just like physical acts of forgery or falsification of physical records.
In practice, however, the investigating agencies file the cases quoting the relevant sections from IPC in
addition to those corresponding in ITA like offences under IPC 463,464, 468 and 469 read with the
ITA/ITAA Sections 43 and 66, to ensure the evidence or punishment stated at least in either of the
legislations can be brought about easily.
The Indian Evidence Act 1872: This is another legislation amended by the ITA. Prior to the passing
of ITA, all evidences in a court were in the physical form only. With the ITA giving recognition to all
electronic records and documents, it was but natural that the evidentiary legislation in the nation be
amended in tune with it. In the definitions part of the Act itself, the “all documents including electronic
records” were substituted. Words like ‘digital signature’, ‘electronic form’, ‘secure electronic record’
‘information’ as used in the ITA, were all inserted to make them part of the evidentiary mechanism in
legislations.
Admissibility of electronic records as evidence as enshrined in Section 65B of the Act assumes
significance. This is an elaborate section and a landmark piece of legislation in the area of evidences
produced from a computer or electronic device. Any information contained in an electronic record
which is printed on a paper, stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media produced by a
computer shall be treated like a document, without further proof or production of the original, if the
conditions like these are satisfied: (a) the computer output containing the information was produced by
the computer during the period over which the computer was used regularly .... by lawful persons.. (b)
the information ...derived was regularly fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the said
activities; (c) throughout the material part of the said period, the computer was operating properly ......
and ......a certificate signed by a person .....responsible..... etc.
14
To put it in simple terms, evidences (information) taken from computers or electronic storage devices
and produced as print-outs or in electronic media are valid if they are taken from system handled
properly with no scope for manipulation of data and ensuring integrity of data produced directly with or
without human intervention etc and accompanied by a certificate signed by a responsible person
declaring as to the correctness of the records taken from a system a computer with all the precautions as
laid down in the Section.
However, this Section is often being misunderstood by one part of the industry to mean that computer
print-outs can be taken as evidences and are valid as proper records, even if they are not signed. We
find many computer generated letters emanating from big corporates with proper space below for
signature under the words “Your faithfully” or “truly” and the signature space left blank, with a Post
Script remark at the bottom “This is a computer generated letter and hence does not require signature”.
The Act does not anywhere say that ‘computer print-outs need not be signed and can be taken as
record’.
The Bankers’ Books Evidence(BBE) Act 1891 Amendment to this Act has been included as the third
schedule in ITA. Prior to the passing of ITA, any evidence from a bank to be produced in a court,
necessitated production of the original ledger or other register for verification at some stage with the
copy retained in the court records as exhibits. With the passing of the ITA the definitions part of the
BBE Act stood amended as: "’bankers
' books’ include ledgers, day-books, cash-books, account-books and all other books used in the
ordinary business of a bank whether kept in the written form or as printouts of data stored in a floppy,
disc, tape or any other form of electro-magnetic data storage device”. When the books consist of
printouts of data stored in a floppy, disc, tape etc, a printout of such entry ...certified in accordance with
the provisions ....to the effect that it is a printout of such entry or a copy of such printout by the
principal accountant or branch manager; and (b) a certificate by a person in-charge of computer system
containing a brief description of the computer system and the particulars of the safeguards adopted by
the system to ensure that data is entered or any other operation performed only by authorised persons;
the safeguards adopted to prevent and detect unauthorised change of data ...to retrieve data that is lost
due to systemic failure or .....
In short, just like in the Indian Evidence Act, the provisions in Bankers Books Evidence Act make the
printout from a computer system or a floppy or disc or a tape as a valid document and evidence,
provided, such print-out is accompanied by a certificate stating that it is a true extract from the official
records of the bank and that such entries or records are from a computerised system with proper
integrity of data, wherein data cannot be manipulated or accessed in an unauthorised manner or is not
lost or tamperable due to system failure or such other reasons.
Here again, let us reiterate that the law does not state that any computerised print-out even if not
signed, constitutes a valid record. But still even many banks of repute (both public sector and private
sector) often send out printed letters to customers with the space for signature at the bottom left blank
after the line “Yours faithfully” etc and with a remark as Post Script reading: “This is a computer
generated letter and hence does not require signature”. Such interpretation is grossly misleading and
sends a message to public that computer generated reports or letters need not be signed, which is never
mentioned anywhere in nor is the import of the ITA or the BBE.
The next Act that was amended by the ITA is the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. Section 58 of the
Act sub-section (2), after clause (p), a clause relating to the regulation of funds transfer through
15
electronic means between banks (ie transactions like RTGS and NEFT and other funds transfers) was
inserted, to facilitate such electronic funds transfer and ensure legal admissibility of documents and
records therein.
Observations on ITA and ITAA:
Having discussed in detail all the provisions of ITA and ITAA, let us now look at some of the broader
areas of omissions and commissions in the Act and the general criticism the Acts have faced over the
years.
Awareness: There is no serious provision for creating awareness and putting such initiatives in place in
the Act. The government or the investigating agencies like the Police department (whose job has been
made comparatively easier and focused, thanks to the passing of the IT Act), have taken any serious
step to create public awareness about the provisions in these legislations, which is absolutely essential
considering the fact that this is a new area and technology has to be learnt by all the stake-holders like
the judicial officers, legal professionals, litigant public and the public or users at large. Especially,
provisions like scope for adjudication process is never known to many including those in the
investigating agencies.
Jurisdiction: This is a major issue which is not satisfactorily addressed in the ITA or ITAA.
Jurisdiction has been mentioned in Sections 46, 48, 57 and 61 in the context of adjudication process and
the appellate procedure connected with and again in Section 80 and as part of the police officers’
powers to enter, search a public place for a cyber crime etc. In the context of electronic record, Section
13 (3) and (4) discuss the place of dispatch and receipt of electronic record which may be taken as
jurisprudence issues.
However some fundamental issues like if the mail of someone is hacked and the accused is a resident of
a city in some state coming to know of it in a different city, which police station does he go to? If he is
an employee of a Multi National Company with branches throughout the world and in many metros in
India and is often on tour in India and he suspects another individual say an employee of the same firm
in his branch or headquarters office and informs the police that evidence could lie in the suspect’s
computer system itself, where does he go to file he complaint. Often, the investigators do not accept
such complaints on the grounds of jurisdiction and there are occasions that the judicial officers too have
hesitated to deal with such cases. The knowledge that cyber crime is geography-agnostic, borderless,
territory-free and sans all jurisdiction and frontiers and happens in ‘cloud’ or the ‘space’, has to be
spread and proper training is to be given to all concerned players in the field.
Evidences: Evidences are a major concern in cyber crimes. Pat of evidences is the ‘crime scene’
issues. In cyber crime, there is no cyber crime. We cannot mark a place nor a computer nor a network,
nor seize the hard-disk immediately and keep it under lock and key keep it as an exhibit taken from the
crime scene.


16
Very often, nothing could be seen as a scene in cyber crime! The evidences, the data, the
network and the related gadgets along with of course the log files and trail of events emanating
or recorded in the system are actually the crime scene. While filing cases under IT Act, be it
as a civil case in the adjudication process or a criminal complaint filed with the police, many
often, evidences may lie in some system like the intermediaries’ computers or some times in
the opponent’s computer system too. In all such cases, unless the police swing into action
swiftly and seize the systems and capture the evidences, such vital evidences could be easily
destroyed. In fact, if one knows that his computer is going to be seized, he would immediately
go for destruction of evidences (formatting, removing the history, removing the cookies,
changing the registry and user login set ups, reconfiguring the system files etc) since most of
the computer history and log files are volatile in nature.
There is no major initiative in India on common repositories of electronic evidences by which
in the event of any dispute (including civil) the affected computer may be handed over to a
common trusted third party with proper software tools, who may keep a copy of the entire disk
and return the original to the owner, so that he can keep using it at will and the copy will be
produced as evidence whenever required. For this there are software tools like ‘EnCase’ wih a
global recognition and our own C-DAC tools which are available with much retrieval facilities,
search features without giving any room for further writing and preserving the original version
with date stamp for production as evidence.
Non coverage of many crimes: While there are many legislations in not only many Western
countries but also some smaller nations in the East, India has only one legislation -- the ITA
and ITAA. Hence it is quite natural that many issues on cyber crimes and many crimes per se
are left uncovered. Many cyber crimes like cyber squatting with an evil attention to extort
money. Spam mails, ISP’s liability in copyright infringement, data privacy issues have not
been given adequate coverage.
Besides, most of the Indian corporate including some Public Sector undertakings use
Operating Systems that are from the West especially the US and many software utilities and
hardware items and sometimes firmware are from abroad. In such cases, the actual reach and
import of IT Act Sections dealing with a utility software or a system software or an Operating
System upgrade or update used for downloading the software utility, is to be specifically
addressed, as otherwise a peculiar situation may come, when the user may not know whether
the upgrade or the patch is getting downloaded or any spyware getting installed. The Act does
not address the government’s policy on keeping the backup of corporates including the PSUs
and PSBs in our county or abroad and if kept abroad, the subjective legal jurisprudence on such
software backups.
We find, as has been said earlier in the chapter, that most of the cyber crimes in the nation are
still brought under the relevant sections of IPC read with the comparative sections of ITA or
the ITAA which gives a comfort factor to the investigating agencies that even if the ITA part of
the case is lost, the accused cannot escape from the IPC part.

To quote the noted cyber law expert in the nation and Supreme Court advocate Shri Pavan
Duggal, “While the lawmakers have to be complemented for their admirable work removing
various deficiencies in the Indian Cyberlaw and making it technologically neutral, yet it
appears that there has been a major mismatch between the expectation of the nation and the
resultant effect of the amended legislation. The most bizarre and startling aspect of the new
amendments is that these amendments seek to make the Indian cyberlaw a cyber crime friendly
legislation; - a legislation that goes extremely soft on cyber criminals, with a soft heart; a
legislation that chooses to encourage cyber criminals by lessening the quantum of punishment
accorded to them under the existing law; ….. a legislation which makes a majority of
cybercrimes stipulated under the IT Act as bailable offences; a legislation that is likely to pave
way for India to become the potential cyber crime capital of the world……”
Let us not be pessimistic that the existing legislation is cyber criminal friendly or paves the way to
increase crimes. Certainly, it does not. It is a commendable piece of legislation, a landmark first step
and a remarkable mile-stone in the technological growth of the nation. But let us not be complacent that
the existing law would suffice. Let us remember that the criminals always go faster than the
investigators and always try to be one step ahead in technology. After all, steganography was used in
the Parliament Attack case to convey a one-line hidden message from one criminal to another which
was a lesson for the investigators to know more about the technology of steganography. Similarly
Satellite phones were used in the Mumbai attack case in November 2008 after which the investigators
became aware of the technological perils of such gadgets, since until then, they were relying on cell
phones and the directional tracking by the cell phone towers and Call Details Register entries only.
Hopefully, more and more awareness campaign will take place and the government will be conscious of
the path ahead to bring more and more legislations in place. Actually, bringing more legislations may
just not be sufficient, because the conviction rate in Cyber crime offences is among the lowest in the
nation, much lower than the rate in IPC and other offences. The government should be aware that it is
not the severity of punishment that is a deterrent for the criminals, but it is the certainty of punishment.
It is not the number of legislations in a society that should prevent crimes but it is the certainty of
punishment that the legislation will bring.
Let us now discuss some of the other relevant legislations in the nation that deal with cyber crimes in
various sectors.
Prevention of Money Laundering Act:
Black money has always been a serious evil in any developing economy. Nation builders, lawmakers
and particularly the country’s financial administrators have always taken persistent efforts to curb the
evil of black money and all sorts of illegally earned income. A major initiative taken in this direction in
India is the Anti Money Laundering Act 2002. A main objective of the Act was to provide for
confiscation of property derived from, or involved in, money laundering.
Money laundering though not defined in the Act, can be construed to mean directly or indirectly
attempting to indulge in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime and projecting it
as untainted property. The Act stipulates that whoever commits the offence of money laundering shall
be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but may
extend to seven years and also be liable to a fine which may extend to five lakh rupees.
Money laundering involves a process of getting the money from illegal sources, layering it in any legal
source, integrating it as part of any legal system like banking and actually using it. Since the banking as
18
an industry has a major and significant role to play in the act of money laundering, it is now a serious
responsibility on the part of banks to ensure that banking channel is not used in the criminal activity.
Much more than a responsibility, it is now a compliance issue as well.
Obligations of banks include maintenance of records of all transactions of the nature and value
specified in the rules, furnish information of the transactions within the prescribed time, whenever
warranted and verify and maintain records of the identity of all customers. Hence, as a corollary,
adherence to Know Your Customer norms and maintenance of all KYC records assumes a very major
significance and becomes a compliance issue. Records of cash transactions and suspicious transactions
are to be kept and reported as stipulated. Non compliance on any of these will render the concerned
bank official liable for the offence of money laundering and guilty under the Act.
e-Records Maintenance Policy of Banks:
Computerisation started in most of the banks in India from end 80’s in a small way in the form of standalone systems called Advanced Ledger Posting Machines (Separate PC for every counter/activity)
which then led to the era of Total Branch Automation or Computerisation in early or mid 90’s. TBA or
TBC as it was popularly called, marked the beginning of a networked environment on a Local Area
Network under a client-server architecture when records used to be maintained in electronic manner in
hard-disks and external media like tapes etc for backup purposes.
Ever since passing of the ITA and according of recognition to electronic records, it has become
mandatory on the part of banks to maintain proper computerized system for electronic records.
Conventionally, all legacy systems in the banks always do have a record maintenance policy often with
RBI’s and their individual Board approval stipulating the period of preservation for all sorts of records,
ledgers, vouchers, register, letters, documents etc.
Thanks to computerisation and introduction of computerized data maintenance and often computergenerated vouchers also, most of the banks became responsive to the computerized environment and
quite a few have started the process of formulating their own Electronic Records Maintenance Policy.
Indian Banks’ Association took the initiative in bringing out a book on Banks’ e-Records Maintenance
Policy to serve as a model for use and adoption in banks suiting the individual bank’s technological setup. Hence banks should ensure that e-records maintenance policy with details of e-records, their nature,
their upkeep, the technological requirements, off-site backup, retrieval systems, access control and
access privileges initiatives should be in place, if not already done already.
On the legal compliance side especially after the Rules were passed in April 2011, on the “Reasonable
Security Practices and Procedures” as part of ITAA 2008 Section 43A, banks should strive well to
prove that they have all the security policies in place like compliance with ISO 27001 standards etc and
e-records are maintained. Besides, the certificate to be given as an annexure to e-evidences as
stipulated in the BBE Act also emphasizes this point of maintenance of e-records in a proper ensuring
proper backup, ensuring against tamperability, always ensuring confidentiality, integrity, availability
and Non Repudiation.
This policy should not be confused with the Information Technology Business Continuity and Disaster
Recovery Plan or Policy nor the Data Warehousing initiatives. Focus on all these three policies (BCDRP, DWH and E-records Maintenance Policy) are individually different, serving different purposes,
using different technologies and maybe coming under different administrative controls too at the
managerial level.

Legislations in other nations:
As against the lone legislation ITA and ITAA in India, in many other nations globally, there are many
legislations governing e-commerce and cyber crimes going into all the facets of cyber crimes. Data
Communication, storage, child pornography, electronic records and data privacy have all been
addressed in separate Acts and Rules giving thrust in the particular area focused in the Act.
In the US, they have the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act popularly known
as HIPAA which inter alia, regulates all health and insurance related records, their upkeep and
maintenance and the issues of privacy and confidentiality involved in such records.
Companies dealing with US firms ensure HIPAA compliance insofar as the data relating to
such corporate are handled by them. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) signed into law in 2002
and named after its authors Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Paul Oxley, mandated a
number of reforms to enhance corporate responsibility, enhance financial disclosures, and
combat corporate and accounting fraud. Besides, there are a number of laws in the US both at
the federal level and at different states level like the Cable Communications Policy Act,
Children’s Internet Protection Act, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act etc.
In the UK, the Data Protection Act and the Privacy and Electronic Communications
Regulations etc are all regulatory legislations already existing in the area of information
security and cyber crime prevention, besides cyber crime law passed recently in August 2011.
Similarly, we have cyber crime legislations and other rules and regulations in other nations.
Conclusion: To sum up, though a crime-free society is Utopian and exists only in dreamland, it should be constant endeavour of rules to keep the crimes lowest. Especially in a
society that is dependent more and more on technology, crime based on electronic offences are
bound to increase and the law makers have to go the extra mile compared to the fraudsters, to
keep them at bay. Technology is always a double-edged sword and can be used for both the
purposes – good or bad. Steganography, Trojan Horse, Scavenging (and even DoS or DDoS)
are all technologies and per se not crimes, but falling into the wrong hands with a criminal
intent who are out to capitalize them or misuse them, they come into the gamut of cyber crime
and become punishable offences. Hence, it should be the persistent efforts of rulers and law
makers to ensure that technology grows in a healthy manner and is used for legal and ethical
business growth and not for committing crimes.

 It should be the duty of the three stake holders viz i) the rulers, regulators, law makers and
investigators ii) Internet or Network Service Providers or banks and other intermediaries and
20
iii) the users to take care of information security playing their respective role within the
permitted parameters and ensuring compliance with the law of the land.
